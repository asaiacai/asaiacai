### 👋 I'm Andrew.

Currently
- I'm CTO at [Trainy](https://trainy.ai/) (YCombinator Summer 2023) where I help customers spin up infrastructure for managing GPU clusters at scale aimed at generative AI training/serving applications. 🤖
- Our reference architecture that I currently work on is [Konduktor](https://konduktor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Kubernetes based platform built using existing open source tools, to make it easier for ML engineers to scale out model training on GPU clusters and give cluster administrators cloud native tools to maintain the health of their GPU clusters. 🚅
- Prior, I was professionally an ML Engineer at Hive AI where I led the ML engineering side for a logo detection product as well as internal research on stylistic transfer via textual inversion for text2image diffusion models.

In a previous life, I was a physics Ph.D. student 👨‍🔬 studying solid-state physics ⚛️ under [Mike Crommie](https://physics.berkeley.edu/research-faculty/crommie-group/). You'll probably find a lot of my old research code here. My personal website is [here](https://ocf.io/asai), opinions my own.
